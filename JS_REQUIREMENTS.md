# REQUIREMENT CHECKLIST:

- [x] The JavaScript application must use Object Oriented JavaScript (classes) to encapsulate related data and behavior.
- [x] The domain model served by the Rails backend must include a resource with at least one has-many relationship. For example, if you were building an Instagram clone, you might display a list of photos with associated comments.
- [x] The backend and frontend must collaborate to demonstrate Client-Server Communication. Your application should have at least 3 AJAX calls, covering at least 2 of Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD). Your client-side JavaScript code must use fetch with the appropriate HTTP verb, and your Rails API should use RESTful conventions.

#### JavaScript

- [x] Use classes and functions to organize your code into reusable pieces.
- [x] Translate JSON responses into JavaScript model objects using ES6 class or constructor function syntax.
- [x] Use ES6 features when appropriate (e.g. arrow functions, `let` & `const`, rest and spread syntax).

#### Rails

- [x] Follow Rails MVC and RESTful conventions. That means, for example, that a request `GET /puppies` ought to be handled by the `PuppiesController`, fetch puppies from the database using a `Puppy` Active Record model, and return a list of puppies as JSON.
- [x] Well-named variables and methods
- [x] Short, single-purpose methods

#### Git

- [x] Aim for a large number of small commits - commit frequently!
- [x] Add meaningful messages to your commits. When you look back at your commits with `git log`, the messages should describe each change.
- [x] Don't include changes in a commit that aren't related to the commit message

### In order to schedule your Project Review, you must submit:

- [x] A link to your project repo, with code for your Rails backend and HTML / CSS / JavaScript frontend.
- [x] A `README.md` file describing your application
- [ ] A **Blog Post** about your application
- [ ] A 2-4 minute **Video Demo** introducing your application
